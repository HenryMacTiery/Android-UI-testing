# Basic FragmentsInIsolationTesting

- This uses a  sample app that has one activity and 3 Fragments in it.  
- The fragments are: MovieDetailFragment, StarActorsFragment and DirectorsFragment.  
- The app also uses a MovieFragmentFactory that is used to manage which Fragment is in view.  
- 2 Movies are ued in this example: InfinityWar and The Rundown.  

- Test classes that were prepared are for each of the fragment plus a Test Suite class to combine the test classes.  

- The tests involve sue of the fragment factory, bundle and scenario before verification using  standard test functions: onView, check, matches and withText.
